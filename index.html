                    friends could love your dog as much as you do, but she is 
                    a canine bulldozer with no regard for personal space.  She is 
                    SUCH a lover, but not everyone appreciates a canine tongue in 
                    their mouth. She wants to be on a lap, but she's 70lbs. She 
                    does zoomies around the living room and the furniture is her 
                    trampoline.
