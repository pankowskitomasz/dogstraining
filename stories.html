                    <strong class="text-green-900">Training challenge: </strong>“Izzy is our first dog and we had 
                    no idea how to work with a fearful or reactive dog. Naively we hired a 
                    few different trainers that used an “alpha” method. A lot of the training 
                    was leaned on punishing bad behaviour, instead of rewarding good behaviour. 
                    These methods made us feel awful, they broke the trust between us and Izzy, 
                    and her behaviour only got worse.”

                    <strong class="text-green-900">Training solution: </strong>“Over the last 
                    six months we have been working with Maren from Paw In Hand. The progress we 
                    have made with Paw In Hand has been amazing. Training strengthens our 
                    relationship with our dog, Izzy is noticeably better in many situations.”

                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-green-900">Training challenge: </strong>“Frank had poor recall skills when he 
                    was at the park and when off-leash. He would target and physically pin intact 
                    male dogs resulting in no physical damage however owners did not want to 
                    traumatize other dogs and worry that he will be judged more harshly.”

                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-green-900">Training solution: </strong>“I developed an incremental plan for recall 
                    work including the use of human food for rewards. Use of long line and progressing 
                    to off leash privileges with consistent response. Body language education: Frank 
                    indicated consistently at a great distance which dogs he was not comfortable with. 
                    He would stiffen, immediately and start to crouch down. We were able to work up 
                    to calling Frank immediately upon seeing body language changes and when taking him 
                    into unknown areas we utilize the long line. We have had zero incidents in four 
                    months since implementing the new training plan.”‘

                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-green-900">Training challenge: </strong>“Aussie knew how to get everyone’s attention 
                    by grabbing things, demand barking and playing keep away. He was skilled at jumping 
                    up onto the counters to get at food left by different members of the family. Aussie 
                    might come when called and if he did he would stop just outside of arms reach. He 
                    loved to greet people at the door with great enthusiasm and jumping. Aussie didn’t 
                    like being touched, definitely didn’t like anyone taking his collar. If he was left 
                    inside his crate with the door closed for more than one second he would bark, whine 
                    and scratch at the door.”

                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong class="text-green-900">Training solution: </strong>“Aussie’s family learned how to use positive 
                    reinforcement to encourage good behaviour. Aussie is now a calmer dog who loves 
                    going into the vehicle, will only demand bark occasionally, has learned that ‘trade’ 
                    is a profitable game to play with his people and can stay in his kennel and relax. 
                    He can walk nicely on leash and has a lovely recall where he will come right up to 
                    his people and let them take his collar!”
